      <p class="desc">
        <strong>Muniverse</strong> is the social hub for Model United Nations delegates, chairs, 
        organizers, and enthusiasts. We exist to connect people who share a passion for diplomacy, 
        debate, and global collaboration. Our platform blends the energy of the MUN circuit with the 
        accessibility of a modern online community — making every moment, from committee sessions 
        to friendships forged in the hallways, part of a lasting digital universe.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Muniverse strives to make Model UN more than just a weekend event. We want to create a 
        living ecosystem where ideas, opportunities, and people thrive:
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>Celebrate Moments:</strong> Share your MUN stories, memories, and highlights with a global audience.</li>
        <li><strong>Discover Opportunities:</strong> Explore upcoming conferences, workshops, and fellowships.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect Beyond Debate:</strong> Build networks, friendships, and collaborations that last long after closing ceremonies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Partnership with SoD</h2>
      <p>
        Muniverse is proud to be an official <strong>partner of the Summit of Diplomacy (SoD)</strong> — 
        one of the world’s most forward-thinking platforms for dialogue, leadership, and global youth diplomacy.  
        Through this partnership, we aim to bridge the gap between the MUN community and wider diplomatic initiatives, 
        giving our members unique access to insights, collaborations, and events at an international level.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="highlight">
        “Together with SoD, we believe the next generation of leaders can connect, collaborate, and create 
        solutions for tomorrow — starting here in Muniverse.”
      </blockquote>
